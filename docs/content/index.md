# Overview

By following the [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops) paradigm,
 this project is able to completely automate the deployment and operation of
 my OpenStack homelab. From bare metal to production can be done in an hour
 or two, following simple instructions.

The project is now permissively licensed - allowing you to use, modify, or
 redistribute it as desired, so long as you retain the original copyright
