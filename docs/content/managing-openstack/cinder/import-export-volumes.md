# Cinder: Import/Export Volumes

If you are redeploying OpenStack, or migrating from another platform, you may
 have existing LVM volumes that you wish to import. To achieve this, you can
 use the `cinder` command.

If you do not have any existing LVM volumes to import, then you can ignore this.

## Dependencies

- [python-cinderclient](https://pypi.org/project/python-cinderclient/)

## Import a volume

1. Copy the credentials file from the OpenStack host to your local system.

    ```sh
    scp root@<openstack-host-ip>:/etc/kolla/admin-openrc.sh /tmp/admin-openrc.sh
    ```

1. Source the credentials file.

    ```sh
    source /tmp/admin-openrc.sh
    ```

1. Import the volume using the `cinder manage` subcommand.

    ```sh
    # Command format
    cinder manage <host> <volume-identifier> --name <desired-name>

    # Example
    cinder manage openstack.homelab.internal lvol1 --name my-cinder-volume
    ```

## Export a volume

Should you need to, you can also export a Cinder volume. This can be useful if
 you ever need to reconfigure Cinder.

```sh
cinder unmanage my-cinder-volume
```
