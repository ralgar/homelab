# Deploying OpenStack

If you don't already have an OpenStack cloud available, you can use the
 included `metal/` module to deploy a single-node lab. For multi-node
 labs you will need to modify the included Ansible roles, or follow the
 [Kolla Ansible documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/)
 to manually deploy your own.

## Initial Configuration

Before we begin deployment, we need to configure everything under the
 highlighted keys in `metal/vars/main.yml`:

!!! tip
    It is strongly recommended to use consistent identifiers to define
    your block devices, such as the WWN identifiers from `/dev/disk/by-id`.

```yaml title="metal/vars/main.yml" hl_lines="7 11 14 34 43"
common:
  # Name (path) of the venv, using the root user's home as the base.
  # Ex. A value of 'kolla-venv' will become '/root/kolla-venv'
  venv: kolla-venv

  # Path to your SSH pubkey file. This will be used to access the node.
  ssh_pubkey_file: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

storage:
  # Target block device for the Openstack host's root filesystem.
  root_device: /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-WD_BLACK_SN770_1TB_23020Q804222

  # Target block device(s) for Ceph (OpenStack volume/shared/object storage)
  ceph_osds:
    - /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6b8ca3a0faf798002bd0bf3c11919471
    - /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6b8ca3a0faf798002d7240bf3ecf84b7
    - /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6b8ca3a0faf798002d7240f041b207bc
    - /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6b8ca3a0faf798002d72410a433d4109
    - /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6b8ca3a0faf798002d72413745f2e841

network:
  # A domain to use for the internal OpenStack infrastructure.
  domain: homelab.internal

  # A hostname/subdomain to assign to the AIO OpenStack node.
  hostname: openstack

  # A list of two public DNS resolvers to use for the network.
  dns_servers: ['1.1.1.1', '1.0.0.1']

  # Configure the OpenStack internal provider network - where SSH and the
  #  OpenStack WebUI and APIs will be exposed.
  # This should connect to your internal (private) LAN.
  internal:
    interface: eno1
    ip_address: 10.254.20.11
    network_cidr: 10.254.20.0/24
    gateway_addr: 10.254.20.1

  # Configure external provider network(s), where OpenStack can create
  #  publicly-accessible IP addresses for your infrastructure.
  # These should be internal DMZs, or public subnets assigned by your ISP.
  external:
    interface: eno2
    type: vlan                # Must be one of 'flat' or 'vlan'.
    vlan_range: [1000, 2000]  # Range of VLANs for Neutron to be aware of.
```

---

## Installing the host OS

1. Run `00-make-kickstart-iso.yml` to generate an ISO file in `output/`.

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook 00-make-kickstart-iso.yml
    ```

1. Write the ISO file to a USB drive (or use PXE boot).

    ```sh
    dd if=<iso-file> of=/dev/<usb-drive> bs=4M conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
    ```

1. Boot the ISO, and wait for the automated installer to finish (the system
   will reboot).

1. After it has finished rebooting, SSH into your new node to confirm that
   it's ready.

    ```sh
    ssh root@<node-ip-address>
    ```

---

## OpenStack Deployment

1. Run `10-deploy-openstack.yml` against your new node.

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i <node-ip-address>, 10-deploy-openstack.yml
    ```

    !!! note
        This process can take some time to complete â€” typically between 45
        minutes and 1 hour.

1. Copy `clouds.yaml` to your OpenStack config directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/openstack
    cp output/clouds.yaml ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
    ```

**With that, your cloud platform should now be fully up and running!**

Now it's time to move on to [deploying the 'admin' project](../deployments/admin.md).
