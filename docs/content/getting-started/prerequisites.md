# Prerequisites

If you want to deploy this project for yourself, there are some basic
 requirements that you'll need.

---

## Knowledge

This project is designed to be extremely easy to use, but that does **not**
 mean it is intended for beginners! We're using advanced concepts here, and
 it's expected that you will fork the project and continue development on
 your own.

You should have intermediate knowledge of the following technologies:

- Linux
- Git
- OpenStack or another cloud platform
- GitLab or another CI/CD platform
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Kubernetes

---

## Hardware

If you don't already have an OpenStack cloud to deploy on, then you'll need
 some suitable hardware.

This project is built and tested against an old Dell T420 tower server, which
 can be had for as little as $400. It's a capable and reliable machine, that
 avoids the significant investment of a rack-mounted setup. Perfect for almost
 any homelab!

### Recommended Specs

You can use any hardware you like, however, provided it meets the following
 recommended specs:

|                 | CPU        | Memory     | Storage          | Network      |
|-----------------|------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Minimum**     | 16 threads | 64 GB RAM  | 1x NVMe + 2x HDD | 2x 1 GbE NIC |
| **Recommended** | 24 threads | 128 GB RAM | 1x NVMe + 4x HDD | 2x 1 GbE NIC |
